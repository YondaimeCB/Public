```


Let's go through the code step by step, with explanations for each line:

```python
from pwn import ssh
import paramiko
```
- **`from pwn import ssh`**: This imports the `ssh` function from the `pwntools` library, which is used to handle SSH connections. `pwntools` is commonly used for CTFs (Capture The Flag) and other security-related scripting.
- **`import paramiko`**: This imports the `paramiko` library, which is a powerful Python implementation for SSH. It's used here primarily for its exceptions.


```python
host = "127.0.0.1"
username = "notroot"
attempts = 0
```
- **`host`**: This variable stores the IP address of the target machine you want to SSH into. `"127.0.0.1"` is the loopback address, meaning it refers to the local machine.
- **`username`**: This is the username you are trying to authenticate as on the target machine.
- **`attempts`**: This is a counter to keep track of how many passwords have been tried.


```python
with open("passwords.txt", "r") as password_list:
```
- **`with open("passwords.txt", "r") as password_list`**: This line opens the file `passwords.txt` in read mode. The file is expected to contain a list of passwords, one per line. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after reading.


```python
    for password in password_list:
        password = password.strip("\n")
```
- **`for password in password_list`**: This loop iterates over each line (password) in the file.
- **`password.strip("\n")`**: This removes the newline character (`\n`) from the end of each password. This is necessary because when reading lines from a file, they typically end with a newline.


```python
        try:
            print("[{}] Attempting password: '{}'!".format(attempts, password))
```
- **`try:`**: This starts a try block, which will attempt to execute the SSH connection. If an error occurs (e.g., wrong password), the script will move to the `except` block.
- **`print("[{}] Attempting password: '{}'!".format(attempts, password))`**: This prints the current attempt number and the password being tried, which is useful for monitoring the progress of the brute force attempt.


```python
            response = ssh(host=host, user=username, password=password, timeout=1)
```
- **`response = ssh(host=host, user=username, password=password, timeout=1)`**: This line attempts to establish an SSH connection using the `ssh` function from `pwntools`. The `timeout=1` ensures that if the connection can't be established within 1 second, it will fail.


```python
            if response.connected():
                print("[>] Valid password found: '{}'!".format(password))
                response.close()
                break
```
- **`if response.connected():`**: This checks if the SSH connection was successful. `connected()` is a method provided by `pwntools` to verify the connection status.
- **`print("[>] Valid password found: '{}'!".format(password))`**: If the connection was successful, this line prints the valid password.
- **`response.close()`**: This closes the SSH connection to free up resources.
- **`break`**: This breaks out of the loop since the valid password has been found.


```python
        except paramiko.ssh_exception.AuthenticationException:
            print("[X] Invalid password!")
```
- **`except paramiko.ssh_exception.AuthenticationException:`**: This block catches the specific exception thrown when authentication fails, indicating an invalid password.
- **`print("[X] Invalid password!")`**: This prints a message indicating the password was invalid.


```python
        except Exception as e:
            print("[!] Exception occurred: {}".format(str(e)))
```
- **`except Exception as e:`**: This block catches any other exceptions that may occur, such as connection timeouts or network errors.
- **`print("[!] Exception occurred: {}".format(str(e)))`**: This prints the error message, providing information on what went wrong.


```python
        attempts += 1

```
- **`attempts += 1`**: This increments the attempt counter after each password trial.

### Summary

The code attempts to brute-force an SSH login by iterating through a list of passwords. It tries each password, checks if the connection is successful, and prints the result. Proper exception handling ensures the script doesn't crash due to common errors like invalid passwords or connection timeouts.
